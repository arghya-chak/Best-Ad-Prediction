This project is based on Data Science.

A dataset has been given which consists of whether a person has clicked on a certain ad or not from a given set of advertisements. Two different algorithms have been implemented, Upper-confidence bound algorithm and Thompson Sampling, on the data. The data has then been represented as a bar chart to show which ad suits the person the best. Both algorithms show similar final results.
